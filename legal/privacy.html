<h2>

<p> We may collect information about your computer, including

<h2>
    Cookies
</h2>

<p> The App and Our Website use cookies to distinguish you from
    other users of our App and Website. This helps us to provide you
    with a good experience when you browse our App and Website and
    also allows us to improve our App and Website. For detailed
    information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we
    use them see our <a target="_blank" href="cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.

<h2>Where we store your personal data</h2>
<p>
    The data that we collect
    from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside
    the European Economic Area ("<b>EEA</b>"). It may also be processed by
    staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our
    suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the
    provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you
    agree to this transfer, storing or processing.  We will take all steps
    reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely
    and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h2>
    Information Security
</h2>

<p>
    All information you provide to us is stored on our secure
    servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a
    password which enables you to access certain parts of the App and
    the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password
    confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

</p>

<p> Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet
    is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect
    your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data
    transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk.
    Once we have received your information, we will use strict
    procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised
    access.
