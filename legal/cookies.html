<p>
We use cookies and similar tools on our website,
<a target="_blank" href="https://dance123.club">dance123.club</a> (the "<b>Website</b>"),
to improve performance and enhance your user experience. This policy
explains how we do that.
</p>

<h2>
What are cookies?
</h2>

<p>
Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your
computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page.  The
cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your
device the next time you visit.  We use the term “cookies” in this
policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.
</p>

<p>
There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can
help us to remember your username and preferences, analyse how
well the Website is performing, or even allow us to recommend
content we believe will be most relevant to you.
</p>

<p> Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if
you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store
your username. Most cookies will not collect information that
identifies you, but will instead collect more general information such
as how users arrive at and use the Website, or your general location.
</p>

<p>
Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:
</p>


<ol>
  <li>
  Essential cookies
      <p>
          Some cookies are essential for the operation of the Website. If you opt to disable these
          cookies, you will not be able to access or use all of the features that the Website
          incorporates.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li>
Performance Cookies
<p> We utilise other cookies to analyse how
our visitors use the Website and to monitor performance. This
allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our
offering and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For
example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which
pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is
most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving
error messages.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
Functionality Cookies
<p>
We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your
preferences. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in
your username every time you use or access the Website, and recall
your customisation preferences.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
   Behaviourally Targeted Advertising Cookies
  <p>
dance123 and our advertisers use cookies to serve you with
advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your
interests. However, we do not tell our advertisers who you are.
  </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>
Does anyone else use cookies on the Website?
</h2>

<p>
Advertisers sometimes use their own cookies to provide you with
targeted advertising. For example, advertisers may use a profile
they have built on sites that you have previously visited to present
you with more relevant advertisements during your use of, or visit
to, the Website. We believe that it is useful to our users to see
advertisements that are more relevant to their interests. If you are
based in the European Union and would like to learn more about
how advertisers use these types of cookies or to choose not to
receive them, please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu"> www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. If you are
based in the United States and would like to learn more, please visit
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</a>
</p>

<p>
We also use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into
the four categories above. For example, like many companies, we
use Google Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. We may
also use third party cookies to help us with market research,
revenue tracking, improving site functionality and monitoring
compliance with our terms and conditions and copyright policy.
</p>

<h2>
Can you block cookies?
</h2>

<p>
As we’ve explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of the Website.
</p>

<p>
However, if you do wish to disable cookies then you can do so by
amending the settings within your browser or mobile device.
</p>

that certain sections of the Website do not work properly
