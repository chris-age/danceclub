# Technology

## The simple/basic setup
* having a DJ in Zoom who pipes the music
* a host who manages the Zoom meeting
* and the guests/dancers

## Advanced Setup
I personally prefer a more advanced setup:
* having a DJ who stream the music to a high quality music livestream (e.g. YouTube or twitch)
* a host who redirects the music livestream into Zoom and who manages the meeting
* and the guests/dancers

This setup has the advantage that the guests/dancers have the option (but are not enforced) to get higher quality audio (because Zoom has only medium audio quality). This is of course just an option â€“ most guest will be ok to get the audio just from Zoom.
